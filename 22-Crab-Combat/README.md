# Part 1 in C / Part 2 in Java
 
Seemed easily feasible in C with a classical "ring buffer"
representation of decks, evolving at each round?

This choice is not sustainable for the second part which
involves memorization of past rounds, thus "Set" collections
are needed, and there is little interest in implementing
them in C for an exercise.

So, let's go for Java's HashSets once more.
